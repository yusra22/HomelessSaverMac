# Homeless Saver

## Project Backgrond
In Malaysia, the lifestyles of people have been increasingly. But there will always be people who are in needs. Homeless Saver Application, as its name might suggest, is a social application designed to provide the necessary information for people to take the initiative and support each other. This application allows their users to search based on their location for the nearest people in need according to the type of help they could provide. On the other hand, it also allows other people to share information about their needs and ask for help in a modern and less embarrassing way.
This software will make it easier for anyone to donate anything they want in a simple way and the least troubling way, because it shows the nearest possible people who need help. Some might ask, if a person is actually in need, they won’t have access to the modern technologies. My answer to that is that anyone can create a profile for these people, by simply provide their location and their contacts. Again, this might not be the case for some families; however, this project is designed to help those who can’t help themselves, and also get people to take the initiative, either donating or by creating profiles for people they know who might need help.
Furthermore, if manual method such as using paper to record all the information about homeless, it will give many disadvantages of the administration. One of them is that manual process is prone to human error. For example, misplacing a file at the wrong section. Manual method is more suited for smaller businesses, but this situation consists large number of user target. Making backup is almost impossible when there is disaster such as flash floods or earthquake. It might affect homeless in needs.
